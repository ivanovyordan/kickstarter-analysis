## Requirements

To run the project you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

Optionally, if you want to play with it, you should install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Evidence VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Evidence.evidence-vscode).

## Running the Project

If you are using VS Code, click the `Start Evidence` button in the bottom status bar. This will install dependencies and open a preview of your project in your browser - you should get a popup prompting you to open in browser.

Or you can use the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run sources
npm exec evidence dev -- --open /
```
